This repository contains the necessary files to allow ANTLR4 
to have a M (or MUMPS) runtime for generated grammars.

There are other github repositories doing this for 
other Programming Languges

* Python - https://github.com/ericvergnaud/antlr4/tree/master/python3-runtime
* C# - https://github.com/tunnelvisionlabs/antlr4cs
